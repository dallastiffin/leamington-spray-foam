Local trade website generator
=============================

    python build.py            rebuild every HTML page (fast, no dependencies)
    python build.py --images   also re-export the photos (needs Pillow)

The markdown file is the single source of truth for all copy. Edit it, run this
script, and every page is rebuilt with consistent navigation, schema, CTAs and
forms. Do not hand-edit the HTML in site/ - it gets overwritten.

site/style.css and site/script.js are NOT generated. Edit those directly.

#  INLINE LINKS IN PROSE
#
#  The markdown parser escapes everything, which meant a link could not be
#  written into body copy at all. The old SitePanda site carried a set of
#  outbound links inside its paragraphs, several of them reciprocal or paid
#  placements on third-party domains, and dropping them silently during the
#  migration would have broken agreements the site owner made.
#
#  So prose now supports exactly one piece of markdown syntax: [text](url).
#  Nothing else. Escaping still happens first, so a stray bracket or ampersand
#  in the copy cannot inject markup.
#
#  External links get target="_blank" plus rel="noopener" - without noopener
#  the opened page gets a handle on this one through window.opener.
#
#  FOLLOW vs NOFOLLOW is deliberately left as a follow link, which is what the
#  SitePanda site does today. Preserving current behaviour is the safe default
#  for a migration. If any of these are paid placements, Google's guidance is
#  that they should carry rel="sponsored" - add "sponsored" to EXTERNAL_REL
#  below and every one of them changes at once. See MIGRATION-RUNBOOK.md.

#  IMAGE PIPELINE  (only runs with --images; requires Pillow)
#  Photos are centre-cropped, resized, then exported as WebP + JPG.
# ==========================================================================
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#  PHOTO SLOT ASSIGNMENT - READ BEFORE CHANGING
#
#  Every photo in this folder was hashed against every other city folder in
#  the Tiffin Developments tree before this build started. 27 of the 28 images
#  supplied for Leamington are BYTE-IDENTICAL to images already assigned on
#  sprayfoaminsulationwindsor.com, grimsbysprayfoaminsulation.com or
#  chathamsprayfoaminsulation.com. The only unique file was a business card.
#
#  That matters more here than on any previous build, because Windsor's
#  SERVICE_AREA list in its own build.py contains the string "Leamington".
#  The two sites are competing for the same searches roughly 50 km apart.
#
#  What is avoidable is two sites in the same trade showing the same picture
#  in the same POSITION, which is the part that actually reads as a network.
#  So every photo below sits in a role it does not hold anywhere else:
#
#    Basement fully insulated       W: basement svc   G: services img -> HERO + og
#    Finished Attic Spray Foam      G: HERO           C: residential  -> attic svc
#    Basement walls with foam       W: gallery                        -> garage svc
#      (that file is misnamed in the shared pool - it is a garage, with the
#       overhead door visible on the left. It is used correctly here.)
#    Crawlspace Spray Foam          W: gallery        G: crawl svc    -> basement svc
#    Crawlspace Spray Foam 2        G: gallery        C: gallery      -> crawl space svc
#    Man spraying into stud wall    W: open-cell svc                  -> new construction
#    Inerior Mould                  unused everywhere                 -> insulation removal
#    garage roof                    W: gallery                        -> commercial svc
#    Spray Foam on Roof             W: commercial svc G: attic svc    -> greenhouse svc
#    Old Wall Re-insulation         W: failed-removal G: gallery      -> about img
#    Two Storey Great Room          W: HERO           G: new constr   -> services img
#
#  No hero is reused as a hero. No service page reuses another site's service
#  slot. If real Leamington photography ever arrives, the hero is the first
#  thing to replace.
#
#  DO NOT USE Caledon Storefront.png. It is a photograph of a different
#  company's premises - the sign reads "Caledon Spray Foam Insulation" - and
#  there is a dental practice's signage beside it. It came with the shared
#  pool and has been deleted from this folder.
#
#  Every one of the 25 usable images was inspected at 400px for third-party
#  branding, including the crew clothing in each one. All crews are in plain
#  unmarked white protective suits. No vehicles, no signage, no logos found.

#  NO GALLERY ON THIS BUILD - THIS IS DELIBERATE
#
#  The gallery needs sources at least 1000px across. After the eleven page
#  slots above are filled, every remaining image in the pool that is large
#  enough is ALREADY in the gallery of either the Windsor site or the Grimsby
#  site. Exactly two candidates were left, and a two-item lightbox looks worse
#  than no lightbox.
#
#  Repeating another site's gallery wholesale is the single most visible
#  duplicate-content signal available, and Windsor serves this same market, so
#  the section is switched off instead. gallery_section() returns an empty
#  string when this list is empty, and script.js simply finds no thumbnails to
#  bind to.
#
#  TO TURN IT BACK ON: get six or more original Leamington photos at 1000px or
#  wider, add them here as (filename, slug, caption), and rebuild. Nothing
#  else needs changing.
